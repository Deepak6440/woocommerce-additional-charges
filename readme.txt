Additional Charges on WC Checkout allows the administrator to add custom fees to a customer's order total conditionally and easily.

== Description ==

Additional Charges on WC Checkout is an extension plugin for the WooCommerce plugin.

The administrator can set the "Title" and "Amount" of the fee they want to add to the customer's order total. This setting can be found under WooCommerce >> Products >> Additional Charges. Once the administrator saves the settings, customers will have this dynamically defined fee added to their order total.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `additional-charges-on-wc-checkout` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, you can change the title of the additional fee from the WooCommerce settings under WooCommerce >> Products >> Additional Charges.

= Will changing the fee amount affect my existing orders? =

No, changing the fee amount will not affect existing orders. It will only reflect in orders placed after the fee is saved by the administrator.
