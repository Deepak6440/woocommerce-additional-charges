Additional Charges on WC Checkout allows the administrator to add custom fees to a customer's order total conditionally and easily.

Additional Charges on WC Checkout is an extension plugin for the WooCommerce plugin.

The administrator can set the "Title" and "Amount" of the fee they want to add to the customer's order total. This setting can be found under WooCommerce >> Products >> Additional Charges. Once the administrator saves the settings, customers will have this dynamically defined fee added to their order total.

1. Upload the `additional-charges-on-wc-checkout` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
